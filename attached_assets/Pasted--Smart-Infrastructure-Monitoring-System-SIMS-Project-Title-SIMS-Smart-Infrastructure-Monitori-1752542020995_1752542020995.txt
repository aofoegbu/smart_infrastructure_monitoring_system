🚰 Smart Infrastructure Monitoring System (SIMS)
Project Title: SIMS — Smart Infrastructure Monitoring System for Utility Networks

💡 Summary:
Design and implement a full-stack, scalable system to monitor and optimize infrastructure (e.g., water, energy, or telecom networks). The system collects data from distributed sensors, processes it in real-time using data pipelines, stores and manages it efficiently, and leverages AI for predictive maintenance, anomaly detection, and operational insights.

🧩 Components and Technologies:
1. System Design
Architecture: Microservices-based, scalable cloud-native system

Deployment: Kubernetes or Docker Compose on cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, or Azure)

Communication: REST/gRPC APIs, WebSocket for real-time updates

Authentication/Authorization: OAuth2/JWT

2. Data Handling
Input Streams: IoT sensor feeds (simulated or real-time)

Processing: Apache Kafka or MQTT for ingestion, Apache Spark/Flink for stream processing

Output: Dashboard + data sent to storage and analytics modules

3. Data Engineering
ETL Pipelines:

Extract: Stream from sensors (e.g., pressure, temperature, flow)

Transform: Clean, normalize, enrich

Load: Into a data warehouse or lake (BigQuery, Snowflake, or S3 + Athena)

Batch & Stream Processing:

Use Spark/Beam for scheduled jobs

Stream analytics using Kafka Streams/Flink

4. Data Management
Storage:

Time-series DB (e.g., InfluxDB or TimescaleDB) for sensor data

Relational DB (PostgreSQL) for asset metadata

NoSQL (MongoDB) for unstructured data

Data Catalog & Governance:

Use tools like Apache Atlas or Amundsen

Define schemas, lineage, versioning

Access Control:

Role-based access to datasets and APIs

5. AI / ML Integration
Anomaly Detection:

Use unsupervised learning (Isolation Forest, Autoencoders) to detect abnormal patterns in sensor data

Predictive Maintenance:

Train models on historical failure logs and sensor trends to predict upcoming failures

Recommendation Engine:

Suggest optimal pressure levels or routing to reduce energy costs or leakage

LLM-based Assistant:

ChatGPT-style assistant that answers queries like:

“Which pipe section has the most anomalies this month?”

“Show recent pressure drops in Zone 4”

🌐 Frontend (Optional but Valuable)
Dashboard: React or Next.js with charts (Recharts, Plotly)

Admin Panel: User and asset management

Real-time map: Sensor status visualization using Leaflet.js or Mapbox

📈 Use Cases
Utility companies (water, power, telecom)

City infrastructure

Smart agriculture

Industrial manufacturing
